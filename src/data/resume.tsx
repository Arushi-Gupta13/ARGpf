    "A Software Engineer (in the making)",
  summary:
    "Ever since I was a kid, I have been fascinated by the world where Finance and Technology meet, which naturally led me to pursue my undergrad in Tech at NIT Jalandhar. I started off as a UI/UX designer, then made the leap into frontend development, and now I am fully embracing the challenge of becoming a full stack developer. I am passionate about turning ideas into real-world projects, one line of code at a time. My love for exploring new things even pushed me to dive into Machine Learning for a project (because who can resist a good challenge, right?). When I am not coding, you will prolly find me lifting weights to balance out my cheesecake addiction. Life is all about finding that perfect mix of code, carbs, and creativity!",
